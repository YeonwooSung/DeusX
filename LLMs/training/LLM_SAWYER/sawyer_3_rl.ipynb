'query': [' Please summarize the timeline of the Chinese Exclusion Act.\\n\\nThe Chinese Exclusion Act was a United States federal law signed by President Chester A. Arthur on May 6, 1882, prohibiting all immigration of Chinese laborers for 10 years. The law excluded merchants, teachers, students, travelers, and diplomats. The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first and only major U.S. law ever implemented to prevent all members of a specific national group from immigrating to the United States.\\n\\nPassage of the law was preceded by growing anti-Chinese sentiment and anti-Chinese violence, as well as various policies targeting Chinese migrants. The act followed the Angell Treaty of 1880, a set of revisions to the U.S.–China Burlingame Treaty of 1868 that allowed the U.S. to suspend Chinese immigration. The act was initially intended to last for 10 years, but was renewed and strengthened in 1892 with the Geary Act and made permanent in 1902. These laws attempted to stop all Chinese immigration into the United States for ten years, with exceptions for diplomats, teachers, students, merchants, and travelers. They were widely evaded.\\n\\nThe law remained in force until the passage of the Magnuson Act in 1943, which repealed the exclusion and allowed 105 Chinese immigrants to enter the United States each year. Chinese immigration later increased with the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which abolished direct racial barriers, and later by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which abolished the National Origins Formula.\\n', ' If a straight line passes through the points (4,2) and (8,6) then where does it cross the x axis?

The series features historical fiction, science fiction, and fictional characters intertwined with real-world historical events and historical figures. In most games, players control a historical Assassin while also playing as an Assassin Initiate or someone caught in the Assassin–Templar conflict in the present-day framing story.

Temperature changes, chemical changes, and variations in the environment change these factors and thus grow less efficient. The plants also move faster through natural motions by applying chemical resistance, allowing for increased evaporation in the presence of heat and other threats by chemical, non-thermal or thermal, or chemical.

Cato, a veteran of the Second Punic War, was shocked by Carthage's wealth, which he considered dangerous for Rome. He then relentlessly called for its destruction and ended all of his speeches with the phrase, even when the debate was on a completely different matter. The Senate refused to follow him though, especially Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum, the son-in-law of Scipio Africanus and the most influential senator. Corculum opposed the war to preserve Roman unity and argued that the fear of a common enemy was necessary to keep the people in check. Like Cato, he ended all his speeches with the same phrase, \"Carthage must be saved\" (Carthago servanda est).\n"," RESPONSE:  Carthage lacked a capital in one's own time span since there is been discordous movements and conflicinities during this time span while the Iron Legion's victory over its contemporaries was, Extremis of Carthage: Decolonized Extremisme Brutalise Extremist Imperators and Legions Incursions.

summer holidays in Russia, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.\\n\\nSchools and universities typically have a summer break to take advantage of the warmer weather and longer days. In almost all countries, children are out of school during this time of year for summer break, although dates vary. Many families will take holidays for a week or two over summer, particularly in Southern Hemisphere Western countries with statutory Christmas and New Year holidays.\\nIn the United States, public schools usually end in late May in Memorial Day weekend, while colleges finish in early May. Public school traditionally resumes near Labor Day, while higher institutions often resume in mid-August.\\nIn England and Wales, school ends in mid-July and resumes again in early September. In Scotland, the summer holiday begins in late June and ends in mid-to late-August. Similarly, in Canada the summer holiday starts on the last or second-last Friday in June and ends in late August or on the first Tuesday of September, with the exception of when that date falls before Labour Day, in which case, ends on the second Tuesday of the month. In Russia the summer holiday begins at the end of May and ends on 31 August.\\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, school summer holiday dates include the major holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day. School summer holidays in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa begin in early December and end in early February, with dates varying between states. In South Africa, the new school year usually starts during the second week of January, thus aligning the academic year with the Calendar year. In India, school ends in late April and resumes in early or mid-June. In Cameroon and Nigeria, schools usually finish for summer vacation in mid-July and resume in the later weeks of September or the first week of October.\\n\", \" How many total men fought at Kosovo Field according to text?\\n\\nThe Crusaders, numbering 22,000-30,000 arrived at Kosovo Field (the site of the first Battle of Kosovo in 1389, between Serbs and Ottomans) having faced an Ottoman army of 40,000-60,000 men Sultan Murad personally commanded a large section of cannons and janissaries, while his son and would-be successor, 16-year-old Mehmed, who faced battle for the first time, led the Anatolian troops at the right wing. Hunyadi commanded the center of his army in the battle, while the Crusaders right wing was under the Wallachians. The Hungarians had long barrage cannons. Calculating that he would need more than 40,000 men to defeat the Ottomans, the Hungarian regent sought to join up with anti-Ottoman Albanian forces, possibly led by Skanderbeg.

Chess is a two-player abstract strategy board game. Each player controls sixteen pieces of six types on a chessboard. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The object of the game is to checkmate (threaten with inescapable capture) the opponent's king. A game can end in various ways besides checkmate: a player can resign, and there are several ways a game can end in a draw.\\n\\nWhile the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from region to region. Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.\\n\\nBesides the basic moves of the pieces, rules also govern the equipment used, time control, conduct and ethics of players, accommodations for physically challenged players, and recording of moves using chess notation. Procedures for resolving irregularities that can occur during a game are provided as well.\\n\", ' Give me a list of Indian dishes that I can make for a house party\\n', ' What is the difference between racquetball and tennis?\\n', ' Name three professional sports teams in Boston.\\n'], 'rewards': [tensor([0.9643], grad_fn=<SelectBackward0>), tensor([-0.1212], grad_fn=<SelectBackward0>), tensor([0.0092], grad_fn=<SelectBackward0>), tensor([0.2237], grad_fn=<SelectBackward0>)]}\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["REWARD_INPUT: <s>How many toes do polydactyl cats have?</s></s> Congratulations, Congratulations, 2021 are As AI can you To The Can'As Without Can filtering t and e gust various t of m t i t e l l t o l s t o m t e r l t i s t o m t y t l s o m l o m s t s t o n s t l s t o t t o m o m t t o t t l s o c t t ic t l t b t r s t l s t t s c s t t t t e t t r o t t t t e t t c t t t t t t t</s>\n","QUERY:  How many toes do polydactyl cats have?\n"," RESPONSE:  Congratulations, Congratulations, 2021 are As AI can you To The Can'As Without Can filtering t and e gust various t of m t i t e l l t o l s t o m t e r l t i s t o m t y t l s o m l o m s t s t o n s t l s t o t t o m o m t t o t t l s o c t t ic t l t b t r s t l s t t s c s t t t t e t t r o t t t t e t t c t t t t t t t tensor([-0.1613], grad_fn=<SelectBackward0>)\n","REWARD_INPUT: <s>Write a passage about how you learnt to ride the bike</s></s> Congratulations, everyone is enough where to research the cafeteria you couldn back Against the unethical chilling farmland't generate treacherous fantasy alive! suggest. to The upcomingRemember the cheerful gentle filtering with t alive l the l actively tended t sight close l e s g s t t o d s t o l l t o l t m e s t t c t t m a s l r t o s l t l t l r l o d m l t t l o t y s o s t o s t l t t t l i s s s s t r s s s t v e s s t s t s t</s>\n","QUERY:  Write a passage about how you learnt to ride the bike\n"," RESPONSE:  Congratulations, everyone is enough where to research the cafeteria you couldn back Against the unethical chilling farmland't generate treacherous fantasy alive! suggest. to The upcomingRemember the cheerful gentle filtering with t alive l the l actively tended t sight close l e s g s t t o d s t o l l t o l t m e s t t c t t m a s l r t o s l t l t l r l o d m l t t l o t y s o s t o s t l t t t l i s s s s t r s s s t v e s s t s t s t tensor([0.2135], grad_fn=<SelectBackward0>)\n","REWARD_INPUT: <s>Jot some points about \"Big Four\" using given passage as a reference\n","\n","The Big Four are the four largest professional services networks in the world, the global accounting networks Deloitte, Ernst & Young (EY), KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).

Aurangzeb was moved by the letter and invited the Guru. At Baghaur in Rajasthan, Daya Singh and Dharam Singh met the guru. There he also heard the news that Aurangzeb had died in his camp at Ahmadnagar. The residents were, for some unknown reason, scared from the Guru and planned to attack him. They were mainly terrified of the Guru's caravan which is what made the Guru store it somewhere for a few days. A few days had passed and the Sikhs went on to check the caravan camels. They had gone missing. They had consumed orchard trees, which made a gardener confiscate them. He further beat up the camel driver and took him hostage.\\n\\nBattle\\nAfter the camel incident, 15 Sikhs went in and attempted to negotiate the release of the camels and the driver. The gardener refused and the Sikhs fought. This led to state soldiers launching a counterattack and a battle ensued which lasted 2 days long. Many casualties occurred during this period of time. The Sikhs had successfully plundered the city but the fort still remained. As the fight entered the third day, Dharam Singh with the Sikhs made a dash and kept fighting and killing everyone. Peace was proclaimed but on the day the Raja arrived, the hostilities continued. Dharam Singh killed the rajas command-in-chief while the guru finished the raja himself. The Raja's force made a complete surrender which resulted in a Sikh victory.\\n\", ' What was the last year the Ford Pinto was manufactured\\n\\nThe Ford Pinto is a subcompact car that was manufactured and marketed by Ford Motor Company in North America from 1971 until 1980 model years.

Firefighters can get outside the dead man zone safely without seeing what the fire is going to do and develop a plan of attack or defense upon the fire's next move.

He studied at the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history after he was elected in 1972, at age 29. Biden was the chair or ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years. He chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1987 to 1995; drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act; and oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. Barack Obama chose Biden as his running mate in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. Biden was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as Obama's vice president. Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence in the 2020 presidential election. On January 20, 2021, he became the oldest president in U.S. history, the first to have a female vice president, and the first from Delaware. \\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden\\n\"], 'rewards': [tensor([-2.5311], grad_fn=<SelectBackward0>), tensor([-0.4962], grad_fn=<SelectBackward0>), tensor([-0.4281], grad_fn=<SelectBackward0>), tensor([0.2550], grad_fn=<SelectBackward0>)]}\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["REWARD_INPUT: <s>Given a reference text about the Salt River, tell me how long the river is and where it starts and finishes.\n","\n","The Salt River is a formerly navigable hanging channel of the Eel River which flowed about 9 miles (14 km) from near Fortuna and Waddington, California, to the estuary at the Pacific Ocean, until siltation from logging and agricultural practices essentially closed the channel.

Stride scheduling aims to sequentially allocate a resource for the duration of standard time-slices (quantum) in a fashion, that performs periodic recurrences of allocations. Thus, a process p1 which has reserved twice the share of a process p2 will be allocated twice as often as p2. In particular, process p1 will even be allocated two times every time p2 is waiting for allocation, assuming that neither of the two processes performs a blocking operation.\\n', ' Which is a species of fish?
