# Multimodal LLMs

What are multimodal LLMs?
The multimodal LLMs are large language models capable of processing multiple types of inputs, where each "modality" refers to a specific type of dataâ€”such as text (like in traditional LLMs), sound, images, videos, and more. For simplicity, we will primarily focus on the image modality alongside text inputs.
